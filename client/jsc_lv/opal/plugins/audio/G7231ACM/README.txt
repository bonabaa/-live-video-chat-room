1. INTRODUCTION
===============

This directory contains the files needed to use the Microsoft ACM G.723.1 codec with 
OpenH323. For obvious reasons, this codec is only available under Windows, although
theoretically is would be possible to load the appropriate DLLs under Linux using one
of the emulation packages available.


2. BUILDING WITH WINDOWS
========================

1. Put the files is in the enclosed ZIP file into a subdirectory within the OpenH323 source 
   tree called:

            openh323/src/acmcodec

2. Create acmcodec.lib by opening the MSVC project file acmcodec.dsp and compiling. Make sure 
   the release and debug versions are created (if required).

3. Ensure that the user program include the acmcodec.h file as follows:

            #include "..\src\acmcodec\acmcodec.h"

4. Ensure that the correct G.723.1 capabilities are included, using a line like the following:

            SetCapability(0, 0, new H323_ACMG7231Capability);
   
5. Ensure that the user program is linked with the correct acmcodec.lib file. 

          openh323/src/acmcodec/debug/acmcodec.lib

              or

          openh323/src/acmcodec/release/acmcodec.lib


3. PERFORMANCE
==============

The Microsoft codec is capable of quite good performance on very modest hardware. No known problems
are outstanding - this codec just works/


4. LICENSING
============

or prohibited by Microsoft.
