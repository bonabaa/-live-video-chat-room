* a2lsp -  Convert predictor coefficients to line spectral pairs
*
* Description:
*  The transfer function of the prediction error filter is formed from the
*  predictor coefficients.  This polynomial is transformed into two reciprocal
*  polynomials having roots on the unit circle. The roots of these polynomials
*  interlace.  It is these roots that determine the line spectral pairs.
*  The two reciprocal polynomials are expressed as series expansions in
*  Chebyshev polynomials with roots in the range -1 to +1.  The inverse cosine
*  of the roots of the Chebyshev polynomial expansion gives the line spectral
*  pairs.  If np line spectral pairs are not found, this routine
*  stops with an error message.  This error occurs if the input coefficients
*  do not give a prediction error filter with minimum phase.
*
*  Line spectral pairs and predictor coefficients are usually expressed
*  algebraically as vectors.
*    lsp[0]     first (lowest frequency) line spectral pair
*    lsp[i]     1 <= i < np
*    pc[0]=1.0  predictor coefficient corresponding to lag 0
*    pc[i]      1 <= 1 <= np
*
* Parameters:
*  ->   Float pc[]
*       Vector of predictor coefficients (Np+1 values).  These are the 
*       coefficients of the predictor filter, with pc[0] being the predictor 
*       coefficient corresponding to lag 0, and pc[Np] corresponding to lag Np.
*       The predictor coeffs. must correspond to a minimum phase prediction
*       error filter.
*  <-   Float lsp[]
*       Array of Np line spectral pairss (in ascending order).  Each line
*       spectral pair lies in the range 0 to pi.
*  <->  old_lsp[] previous line spectral pairs should it not be able to 
*       find all

* Description:
*  The series expansion in Chebyshev polynomials is defined as
*
*              N-1
*       Y(x) = SUM c(i) T(i,x) ,

*  Chebyshev polynomial, and T(i,x) is the i'th order Chebyshev polynomial
*  evaluated at x.
*
*  The Chebyshev polynomials satisfy the recursion
*    T(i,x) = 2x T(i-1,x) - T(i-2,x),

*  x -          Input value
*  ->  Float []
*  c -          Array of coefficient values.  c[i] is the coefficient of the

*   dependence on x,
*     c(i) = b(i) - 2xb(i+1) + b(i+2).
