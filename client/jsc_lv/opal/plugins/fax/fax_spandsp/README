Requirements
------------

This plugin requires two external source code projects.

1) spandsp

Spandsp is a GPL library and suite of programs that implement
a faxmodem. It is available from the following URL:

    http://www.soft-switch.org/downloads/spandsp

This must be compiled and installed.

1) spandsp_util

This is a GPL program that implements a stand-alone fax endpoint
or T.38 to fax gateway using spandsp. It provides external interfaces
that use network sockets, and can thus be invoked by non-GPL programs.

Spandsp_util can be downloaded from the CVS at :

    http://sourceforge.net/projects/voxgratia/

This code is assumed to be in the directory ./spandsp_util. 

IMPORTANT NOTE
--------------

The spandsp_util and spandsp programs are released under the GPL
license. The spandsp_fax plugin is released under the MPL license.
This means that distribution of aggregated source code and/or binaries
is somewhat problematic.

The intent is that spandsp_fax should invoke spandsp_util to perform
the fax functions, and hence conform to the GPL. Until this is done,
be careful :)
