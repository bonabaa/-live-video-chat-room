Building from source
====================

Requirements
------------

Two external source code projects are needed in order to build spandsp_util from source

1) libtiff

libtiff is TIFF handling library and is required provides the ability
to load and save fax image files, which are in TIFF format.

On most Linux systems, this library will be preinstalled. If not, it 
will almost certainly be available to install via yum/yast etc. 

A pre-compiled Windows version is available from the following URL:

   http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/tiff.htm

Downloading and installing the complete package is recommended. 

Don't be tempted to use the Win32 of libtiff. It won't work 

Once installed, add "C:\Program Files\GnuWin32\include" to the Include directory
list, and "C:\Program Files\GnuWin32\lib" to the Library directory list. The path 
"C:\Program Files\GnuWin32\bin" must also be added to the PATH environment variable,
else the libtiff DLL files will not be found at runtime.

2) spandsp

Spandsp is a GPL library and suite of programs that implement
a faxmodem. 

On most Linux systems, this library will be preinstalled. If not, it 
can be downloaded from the site below, then compiled and installed as usual.

    http://www.soft-switch.org/downloads/spandsp

You will need to add "C:\Program Files\GnuWin32\include" to the Include directory
list, and "C:\Program Files\GnuWin32\lib" to the Library directory list

Windows users will need to download and compile the library. A link to a suitably modified 
version of the library will be included here at a later date.

Common problems
---------------

If you see errors such as the following:

spandsp_if.cpp(912) : error C2664: 't38_core_rx_ifp_packet' : cannot convert parameter 2 from 'const unsigned char *__w64 ' to 'int'
spandsp_if.cpp(1101) : error C2664: 't38_core_rx_ifp_packet' : cannot convert parameter 2 from 'const unsigned char *__w64 ' to 'int'

then uncomment the line '#define SPANDSP_VER3  1' near the top of spandsp_if.h


=========================================================================================

IMPORTANT NOTE
--------------

Spandsp_util is released under the GPL as this is required by spandsp. This differs
from the rest of OPAL which is MPL.
