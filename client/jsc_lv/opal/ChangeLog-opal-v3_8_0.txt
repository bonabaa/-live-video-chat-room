	* [r23230] src/sip/sippdu.cxx:
	  Fixed bug ID: 2831204 "Invalid request-uri in BYE request",
	  reported anonymously.
	  
	  The problem was nothing to do with the BYE message though this
	  was the symptom observed. The actual issue was the incorrect
	  parsing of quoted URI header values which might contain angle
	  brackets in a double quoted the field parameter, e.g. "2003"
	  <sip:2003@172.19.240.80:5060;transport=udp>;+sip.instance="<urn:uuid:00000000-0000-1000-8000-00085D19E033>"
	  
	  This confused the parser and ended up with an incorrect Contact
	  field which propagated through to the BYE message.

	  Apparent 32 bit integer wraparound problem.

	* [r23246] include/sip/handlers.h, include/sip/sipep.h,
	  src/sip/handlers.cxx, src/sip/sipep.cxx:
	  Fixed problem with REGISTER IntervalTooBrief response handling
	  not using correct interface for new transaction.
	  
	  Make sure the multiple interface forked transactions for all
	  REGISTER/SUBSCRIBE/etc is collapsed when any response is
	  received.
	  
	  Cleaned up the handling of non-connection related SIP responses,
	  don't break them out in the endpoint, do so in the handler where
	  it is more useful.

2009-08-22 01:23  rjongbloed

	  samples/opalgw/main.cxx, samples/simple/main.cxx,
	  src/sip/handlers.cxx, src/sip/sipep.cxx:
	  Changes so that when dealing with SIP
	  registrations/subscriptions, address-of-record and target-host
	  URI's are handled consistently.
	  
	  Specifically, if you go sipEP->Register("me", "there.org"); twice
	  the second call will no longer create a second registration but
	  find the first one and just update it.
	  
	  Deprecated old Register() function that does not return the
	  calculated AOR, which must be used in
	  IsRegistered()/Unregister().
	  
	  Also removed some compiler warnings.

2009-08-22 04:24  rjongbloed

	* [r23250] src/sip/handlers.cxx:
	  Make sure the insertion and search for SIP handlers use exactly
	  the same method for constructing the index key.

2009-08-22 04:24  rjongbloed

2009-08-22 04:27  rjongbloed

	* [r23252] ., src/sip/handlers.cxx:
	  Change to not use PTimer in handler state activation as it can
	  deadlock when the timer is destroyed, which will happen as it is
	  a local variable. Not sure exactly how this is deadlocking, it
	  seems to be quite a chain of locks, for the moment we just avoid
	  it.

2009-08-22 04:54  rjongbloed

	* [r23253] include/codec/opalplugin.h,
	  include/codec/opalpluginmgr.h, src/codec/opalpluginmgr.cxx:
	  Added ability for video decoder plug in to indicate that the
	  output buffer needs to be resized. Useful for things like H.263
	  where it could change from QCIF to CIF on the fly and require a
	  larger YUV frame.
	  
	  Optimised the video output to re-use the previously allocated
	  output frame. As video frames can be large, when the heap gets a
	  bit fragmented it slows the system down substantially to search
	  for a large enough free memory block, so as we don't have to make
	  a new one every time, let's not.

2009-08-24 05:46  rjongbloed

	* [r23255] src/sip/handlers.cxx:
	  Fixed failure to clean out register/subscribe handlers URL index
	  table when handler is removed. Causes confusion when
	  unregistering and then re-registering using the same credentials.

2009-08-24 09:50  rjongbloed

	* [r23259] src/opal/transcoders.cxx:
	  Fixed integer overflow error with RTP timestamps. Also optimised
	  slightly as calculation is only required in the very rare
	  occasions where audio physical clock rate is different from
	  logical clock rate (e.g. G.722)

2009-08-25 01:25  rjongbloed

	* [r23265] plugins/audio/G722/g722codec.c:
	  Added compile time option for experimental media format for G.722
	  that advertises in SDP that it is 16000Hz rather than the RFC
	  mandated 8000Hz.

2009-08-25 05:35  rjongbloed

	  src/opal/mediastrm.cxx, src/opal/patch.cxx, src/t38/t38proto.cxx:
	  Cleaned up API associated with call back functions on a media
	  patch thread start/stop. Very inconsistent and worse the call
	  back from OpalConnection was not calling the callback on the
	  OpalManager, causing a break in the chain. Now all functions are
	  consistently named and parametered.

2009-08-26 00:14  rjongbloed

	* [r23269] src/sip/sipep.cxx:
	  Do not pre-emptively remove failed SIP register handler if
	  REGISTER fails. Must be garbage collected later or causes crash
	  due to transactions needing the transport contained in the
	  handler instance.

2009-08-27 00:19  rjongbloed

	* [r23272] plugins/fax/fax_spandsp/ReadMe.txt:

	  src/opal/mediastrm.cxx, src/opal/opalmixer.cxx,
	  src/opal/rtpep.cxx:
	  Added detection of "hair pinned" connection where both ends of
	  the RTP media session are in the same process. Under some
	  circumstances the application can make optimisations for the flow
	  of media, not requiring media patch threads, RTP sockets, codecs
	  etc.
	  
	  Also cleaned up some documentation and usage for media stream
	  RequiresPatchThread() function.

2009-08-27 11:43  rjongbloed

	* [r23281] include/opal/rtpep.h, src/opal/rtpep.cxx:

2009-08-28 01:42  rjongbloed

	* [r23288] ., include/sip/handlers.h, src/sip/handlers.cxx:

	  Changed the "hack" to limit SIP registration Contact fields
	  ("%LIMITED" string as contact) to an enum of various
	  "compatibility modes". This is a little more "self documenting"
	  and also allows for the more strict registrars that do not like

2009-10-07 12:04  rjongbloed

	* [r23603] src/h323/h323.cxx:
	  Added protection for request mode for the current mode, that is

	* [r23624] include/sip/sipcon.h, src/sip/sipcon.cxx:
	  Fixed authentication issue when can get to SIP server via two

2009-10-09 02:08  rjongbloed

	  Added extra bulletproofing for race condition if user starts a
	  new REGISTER/SUBSCRIBE just as the old one had become
	  Unsubscribed, and is thus marked for removal. The
	  registration/subscription would mysteriously disappear.

2009-10-09 02:39  rjongbloed

2009-10-09 12:12  rjongbloed

	* [r23634] src/sip/handlers.cxx:
	  Changed authentication failure to be fatal and SIP handler
	  removed. Credentials that are bad are unlikely to magically start
	  working without user providing a new registration data so may as
	  well register from scratch. Makes certain other logic simpler.

	* [r23638] src/win32/opal_lib_2005.vcproj:

	  Fixed Route header being included in INVITE. The RFC is a bit

	  Cleaned up redundant member variables on SIPPresenceInfo class,
	  m_address and m_entity are the same thing.
	  
	  More work on XCAP, now can get/set authentication rules by node
	  and not have to download alter and upload whole file.
	  
	  Added ability to have synonyms for OpalPresentity factory from

	  onerous side effects when switching back to audio.

2009-11-04 00:16  rjongbloed

	* [r23749] ., src/sip/sipcon.cxx:
	  Disable in-band DTMF detect as soon as we receive a SIP INFO
	  message for DTMF. There apparently no standard way to indicate if
	  a gateway is going to send INFO or not (there is for RFC2833) so
	  you don;t know if you need to do in-band DTMF decode until the
	  first DTMF is sent. Note that there is an inherent race condition
	  there, so unless the gateway suppresses the DTMF in the audio
	  stream it is possible for the first digit to be doubled.

	  are via the same proxy.

2009-11-05 05:19  rjongbloed

	* [r23754] src/sip/sippdu.cxx:
	  Fixed backward compatibility, if
	  SIPRegister::Params::m_registrarAddress is just an address/host
	  (no '@') then it is assumed to be a proxy for the registrar and
	  handled accordingly.

	* [r23759] ., include/sip/sipcon.h, src/sip/sipcon.cxx,
	  src/sip/sippdu.cxx:
	  Fixed being able to send BYE that requires authentication. This
	  has the added requirement that ANY transaction that depends on
	  the SIPConnection, must be waited for in OnReleased() and the
	  transactions may change from the member variables we are tracking
	  due to a new one being created by the authorisation system. So
	  need a catch all list.

	  In process had to:
	  
	  Fix statistics in spandsp plug in, did not make distinction
	  between final and intermediate values.
	  
	  Add the ability to control the RFC2833 capability inclusion and
	  options. It was always added, but now must be in the connections
	  media format list. This will be automatic unless the users
	  application explicitly removes it via the media format mask in

	  Fixed fall back in H.323 if the Mode Request is rejected.

	  future compatibility across the non-normalised structures. If one
	  gets changed and the other doesn't, it would be bad.
	  
	  Added text version of error codes in fax statistics.

	  Fixed issue where bad registrars can return multiple identical
	  entries in the Contact field after doing stupid things like
	  removing the transport address or port number from our proposal.
	  Reported by ted szoczei
	  
	  Also improved the parsing of the Contact field so if had a
	  display name that looked like "Bloggs, Fred" the comma inside a
	  quote would not confuse it.
	  
	  Finally, again to work around bad registrars, if the registrar
	  does not put a port number in the returned Contact URI, even
	  though we supplied one, we explicitly add it. THis is due to the
	  rules for URI comparison are that no port supplied is different
	  from using the default port. Which in turn is due to a port-less
	  URI meaning a DNS SRV record look up. However, that sort of look
	  up should never occur in a URI from a Contact field, which should
	  always be an explicit location to avoid circular references. So
	  if port absent, we add the default.

	  Added ability to set a bypass of internal media handling, passing
	  RTP data directly from one call to another.
	  
	  This can be useful for back to back calls that happen to be the
	  same media format and you wish to avoid double decoding and
	  encoding of media. Note this scenario is not the same as two
	  OpalConnections within the same OpalCall, but two completely
	  independent OpalCall where one connection is to be bypassed. For
	  example, two OpalCall instances might have two SIPConnection
	  instances and two OpalMixerConnection instances connected via a
	  single OpalMixerNode. Now while there are ONLY two calls in the
	  node, it is a waste to decode the audio, add to mixer and
	  re-encode it again. In practice this is identical to just
	  bypassing the mixer node completely, until a third party is
	  added, then we need to switch back to normal (non-bypassed)
	  operation.

	  Szoczei

2010-01-16 03:43  rjongbloed

	* [r23942] plugins/audio/G.722.2/G7222Codec.cpp:
	  Harmonised new G.722.2 codec plug in media options with
	  IPP-CODECS version. Most options do not actually do anything ...
	  yet.

2010-01-18 01:22  rjongbloed

	* [r23943] include/h323/channels.h, src/h323/channels.cxx:
	  Fixed possible race condition in closing H.323 logical channels
	  under heavy load. The Close() function could be called by
	  multiple threads, need to make sure is idempotent.

2010-01-18 10:13  rjongbloed

	* [r23944] include/sip/sdp.h, include/sip/sipcon.h,
	  src/sip/sdp.cxx, src/sip/sipcon.cxx:
	  Fixed log standing issue with changing codecs in SIP. Centres
	  around the fact that there are no "capabilities" as such, so if
	  we initiated the call, we need to assume the other side can do
	  everything, so set the "remote capabilities" to the same as our
	  local capabilities. Brought to a head due to some issues with fax
	  switching.

2010-01-18 22:46  rjongbloed

	* [r23945] src/h323/channels.cxx:
	  Fixed stupid mistake in previous check in to fix race condition.

2010-01-18 23:09  rjongbloed

	* [r23946] include/opal/connection.h, src/h323/h323.cxx,
	  src/opal/connection.cxx, src/sip/sipcon.cxx:
	  Removed apparently redundant function, whatever needed it can
	  simply use GetOtherConnection()->GetMediaFormats() in their
	  SetUpConnection() function.

2010-01-19 07:13  rjongbloed

	* [r23948] include/opal/opalmixer.h, src/opal/opalmixer.cxx:
	  Fixed some backward compatibility issues with mixer classes.

2010-01-20 02:07  rjongbloed

	* [r23949] src/sip/sipcon.cxx:
	  Fixed issue (again) with re-INVITE switching codecs.

2010-01-20 07:21  rjongbloed

	* [r23952] include/opal/opalmixer.h, src/opal/opalmixer.cxx:
	  Fixed mistake in previous check in for mixer code.

2010-01-20 08:08  rjongbloed

	* [r23953] include/opal/connection.h, include/opal/opalmixer.h,
	  src/opal/connection.cxx, src/opal/opalmixer.cxx:
	  Added GetBoolean() and GetInteger() functions to
	  OpalConnection::StringOptions class for convenience.

2010-01-20 23:11  rjongbloed

	* [r23954] src/opal/connection.cxx:
	  Changed the OpalConnection::StringOptions::GetBoolean() so if the
	  option is present but empty, then that corresponds to a "true"
	  value. Suggested by Vyacheslav Frolov.

2010-01-21 02:40  rjongbloed

	* [r23955] include/rtp/rtp.h, samples/openphone/main.cxx,
	  samples/openphone/openphone.wxg, samples/openphone/openphone.xrc,
	  src/opal/mediastrm.cxx, src/rtp/rtp.cxx:
	  Added packets lost and jitter statistics for our transmitted RTP
	  data, obtained from remote RTCP receiver reports.
	  
	  Added packets too late to receiver reports packets lost, they may
	  as well be if they were not played.
	  
	  Fixed decoding of receiver report data from RTCP SR packet.
	  
	  Removed assumption that audio is 8kHz for jitter calculation.

2010-01-21 07:36  rjongbloed

	* [r23957] src/opal/ivr.cxx, src/opal/opalmixer.cxx:
	  Fixed user input support when SIP is used with IVR or mixer
	  endpoints.

2010-01-21 07:54  rjongbloed

	* [r23958] include/opal/call.h, include/opal/manager.h,
	  src/opal/call.cxx:
	  Fixed memory leak and exit lock up when get a (very unusual) call
	  creation failure where the "party A" endpoint prefix exists but
	  it does not create the connection due to an internal error.

2010-01-21 09:37  rjongbloed

	* [r23961] Makefile.in, samples/callgen/main.cxx:
	  Fixed compiltaion without Expat on Unix.

2010-01-22 04:40  rjongbloed

	* [r23963] samples/openphone/main.cxx, samples/openphone/main.h,
	  samples/openphone/openphone.wxg, samples/openphone/openphone.xrc:
	  Added menu to OpenPhone to restore video windows position after
	  they go walkabout (e.g. on a screen that no longer exists)

2010-01-22 05:02  rjongbloed

	* [r23964] include/opal/patch.h, src/codec/opalpluginmgr.cxx,
	  src/opal/patch.cxx:
	  Fixed synchronisation of media bypass when video is use, have to
	  wait until teh next Intra frame arrives before we switch to
	  bypass mode.

2010-01-22 07:50  rjongbloed

	* [r23965] samples/openphone/main.cxx, samples/openphone/main.h:
	  Fixed problem with OpenPhone sometimes not being able to send
	  User Input (DTMF) due to multiple sources of the media format and
	  recent requirement that it be in the capability list for
	  inclusion in SIP commands. In process removed now redundant
	  indication of the subsystem that is supplying the particular
	  media format (pc/ivr etc) as does not really mean anything.

2010-01-22 08:22  rjongbloed

	* [r23966] include/sip/sdp.h, src/sip/sdp.cxx:
	  Fixed handling of FMTP strings (getting them to the
	  OpalMediaOptions) broken in recent change to support multiple
	  media formats with same encoding name.

2010-01-22 08:25  rjongbloed

	* [r23967] src/opal/transcoders.cxx, src/sip/sipcon.cxx:
	  Cleaned up some extraneous messages and chunks of redundant
	  execution of code.

2010-01-22 09:12  rjongbloed

	* [r23968] src/opal/transcoders.cxx:
	  Fixed breakage from previous check in, line lose by accident.

2010-01-23 00:16  rjongbloed

	* [r23969] samples/openphone/main.cxx:
	  Added media type to global list of media formats in OpenPhone.

2010-01-23 00:28  rjongbloed

	* [r23970] src/codec/opalpluginmgr.cxx:
	  Restore old code for video encoder loop, no idea why the new
	  memory optimised code doesn't always work, but there are
	  complaints of video working fine before this change and not
	  working after it. Oh well, I suppose allocating the RTP packets
	  for transmission every time is not THAT big an overhead.

2010-01-23 02:39  rjongbloed

	* [r23972] src/opal/call.cxx:
	  Make sure selected media formats for transmission are clamped to
	  the global settings for media options.

2010-01-25 00:33  rjongbloed

	* [r23973] include/opal/patch.h, src/opal/patch.cxx,
	  src/opal/recording.cxx:
	  Fixed compilation with video disabled.

2010-01-25 00:42  rjongbloed

	* [r23974] src/t38/t38proto.cxx:
	  Applied patch ID: 2920672 "Switching to T.38 mode fix", thanks
	  Vyacheslav Frolov

2010-01-25 01:28  rjongbloed

	* [r23978] src/opal/ivr.cxx:
	  Added a bit more to the logging for IVR file playback

2010-01-25 01:28  rjongbloed

	* [r23979] opal.dxy:
	  Added reference to simplified API in opal.h

2010-01-25 01:30  rjongbloed

	* [r23980] include/opal.h:
	  More documatation improvements

2010-01-25 08:12  rjongbloed

	* [r23981] src/opal/mediafmt.cxx:
	  Make sure default max video output packet size does not interfere
	  with H.264 media packetization mode zero. While this mode is
	  broken IMHO, often requiring very large UDP packets with no easy
	  way to avoid them, we have to support it. Though we draw a line
	  at 8kb packets, have to have a limit somewhere!

2010-01-26 00:06  rjongbloed

	* [r23984] include/opal/call.h, src/opal/call.cxx:
	  Added support for consultation transfer (via call token) in
	  OpalCall::Transfer() function. Updated documentation.

2010-01-28 05:55  rjongbloed

	* [r23986] plugins/audio/G.722.1/G7221Codec.c, src/sip/sdp.cxx:
	  Fixed issue where can select an OpalMediaFormat that has a
	  required FMTP option in the SDP. That is, if the option is
	  "EqualMerge" and maps to a FMTP parameter, they must match in
	  value before the OpalMediaFormat is included in the list for the
	  SDP. Very useful for picking different formats which use the same
	  "encoding name" and are only distinguished by an FMTP parameter
	  value.
	  
	  Also fixed passing of raw FMTP string value on incoming SDP to a
	  plug in that defines an option called "FMTP". Worked for
	  outgoing, but not incoming if that incoming string happened to
	  have a ';' or '=' sign in it.

2010-01-28 06:09  rjongbloed

	* [r23987] src/sip/sipcon.cxx:
	  Fixed REFER with "replaces" parameter (used for consultation
	  transfer) whhere the to-tag and from-tag were swapped, thanks
	  Samuel Widmer

2010-01-29 01:28  rjongbloed

	* [r23988] include/opal/manager.h:

2010-01-29 01:30  rjongbloed

	* [r23989] include/opal/pres_ent.h, src/opal/pres_ent.cxx:
	  Added default implementation for OpalPresentity::SendCommand(),
	  just calls the command synchronously.

2010-01-30 23:14  rjongbloed

	* [r23993] include/opal/pres_ent.h, include/sip/sippres.h,
	  src/opal/pres_ent.cxx, src/sip/sippres.cxx:
	  Changed presentity data items from PString to PURL, as they are
