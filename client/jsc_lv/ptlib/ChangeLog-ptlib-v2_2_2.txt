	* [r20404] include/ptlib/ipsock.h, src/ptclib/pstun.cxx,
	  src/ptlib/common/sockets.cxx:
	  Due to some particularly bizarre behaviour by Windows Mobile, the
	  gethostbyname() call was changed to use getaddrinfo().
	  Documentation says gethostbyname() is deprecated and should not
	  be used. It appears so as get phantom NO_DATA errors from it when
	  the DNS name well and truly exists.
	  
	  Also improved some error logging.

	* [r20463] src/ptclib/sockagg.cxx:
	  Fixed namespace for find function, possible reason for some
	  compiler issues with it.

	* [r20464] make/unix.mak:
	  Attempt to make SUSE packager happy making the lib name same as
	  package
	  name (both ptlib).

	* [r20468] include/ptlib/msos/ptlib/sound_directsound.h,
	  src/ptlib/common/pluginmgr.cxx,
	  src/ptlib/msos/sound_directsound.cxx,
	  src/ptlib/msos/sound_win32.cxx:
	  Fixed issue with WindowMultimedia and DirectSound device names
	  not being identical, which as they are the same device they
	  should be. Making them identical means they then get the driver
	  type prefix making it easier (possible) for a user to distinguish
	  between them.
	  
	  Also cleaned up the enumeration code in DirectSound.

	* [r20482] src/ptlib/msos/PTLib_2005.vcproj:
	  Fixed deployment directory for MobileOPAL

2008-07-10 05:55  rjongbloed

	* [r20559] src/ptlib/common/osutils.cxx,
	  src/ptlib/common/pchannel.cxx:
	  Fixed some Windows Mobile compatibility issues with logging, no
	  "text" mode on files, not properly cleaned up and the big one
	  where the standard C open() function can return a negative number
	  as a valid file handle. Have to explicitly look for os_handle ==
	  -1 rather than os_handle < 0 for error.

2008-07-25 08:34  rjongbloed

	* [r20617] src/ptlib/common/pluginmgr.cxx:
	  Include current directory in Windows Mobile plug in directory
	  search.

	* [r20742] src/ptclib/cypher.cxx, src/ptclib/httpsvc.cxx,
	  src/ptclib/inetmail.cxx, src/ptclib/inetprot.cxx,
	  src/ptclib/podbc.cxx, src/ptclib/sockagg.cxx:
	  Backport gcc 4.3.1 fixes from head

2008-08-28 02:07  rjongbloed

	* [r20746] src/ptlib/common/safecoll.cxx:
	  Fixed issue if re-use a PSafePtr using the collection assignment,
	  e.g. code like:
	  
	  PSafePtr<MyObj> ptr;
	  while ((ptr = myList) != NULL) {
	  ptr->DoSomething();
	  myList.Remove(ptr);
	  }

2008-08-31 06:22  rjongbloed

	* [r20791] src/ptlib/common/osutils.cxx:
	  Only do synchronous stop of a timer if it was not already
	  stopped. This avoids some potential deadlocks where timer is
	  stopped elsewhere by the logic.

2008-09-02 09:06  rjongbloed

	* [r20821] ., include/ptlib/pprocess.h,
	  src/ptlib/common/osutils.cxx:
	  Back ported issue r20135 from trunk:
	  
	  Fixed problem with (re)starting timers within OnTimeout functions

2008-09-03 01:33  rjongbloed

	* [r20827] src/ptlib/common/osutils.cxx:
	  Fixed issue in timers where if a timer is started and it has been
	  a long time since the last time a timer expired, then expires the
	  new timer early or immediately.

2008-09-03 04:06  rjongbloed

	* [r20835] ., src/ptlib/msos/vfw.cxx:
	  Fixed incorrect size of initially created video output window. is
	  correct if window is resized but if never changes does not allow
	  for title bars and borders so is slightly squashed.
