	* [r20976] Makefile.in, configure, configure.ac, ptlib.pc.in,
	  ptlib_debug.pc.in:
	  Fixed issues with "local" builds, i.e. ones that are not
	  installed and
	  are pointed to by PTLIBDIR. To configure a "local" build now can
	  either
	  have PTLIBDIR set before calling configure, or set the install
	  prefix to
	  the local directory, e.g. --prefix=`pwd`
	  
	  Fixed issues with using pkg-config for debug and static versions
	  of
	  library. Now only one .pc file is required and library is
	  selected via a
	  "suffix" define that the application can set to _d or _s for
	  debug and
	  static builds respectively.
