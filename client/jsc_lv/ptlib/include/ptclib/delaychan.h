/** Class for implementing a "delay line" channel.
    This indirect channel can be placed in a channel I/O chain to limit the
    speed of I/O. This can be useful if blocking is not available and buffers
    could be overwritten if the I/O occurs at full speed.

    There are two modes of operation. In stream more, data can be read/written
    no faster than a fixed time for a fixed number of bytes. So, for example,
    you can say than 320 bytes must take 20 milliseconds, and thus if the
    application writes 640 byets it will delay 40 milliseconds before the next
    write.

    In frame mode, the rate limiting applies to individual read or write
    operations. So you can say that each read takes 30 milliseconds even if
    on 4 bytes is read, and the same time if 24 bytes are read.
