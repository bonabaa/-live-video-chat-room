/** A class representing a modem attached to a serial port. This adds the usual
   modem operations to the basic serial port.
   
   A modem object is always in a particular state. This state determines what
   operations are allowed which then move the object to other states. The
   operations are the exchange of strings in "chat" script.
   
   The following defaults are used for command strings:
       initialise         <CODE>ATZ\\r\\w2sOK\\w100m</CODE>
       deinitialise       <CODE>\\d2s+++\\d2sATH0\\r</CODE>
       pre-dial           <CODE>ATDT</CODE>
       post-dial          <CODE>\\r</CODE>
       busy reply         <CODE>BUSY</CODE>
       no carrier reply   <CODE>NO CARRIER</CODE>
       connect reply      <CODE>CONNECT</CODE>
       hang up            <CODE>\\d2s+++\\d2sATH0\\r</CODE>
