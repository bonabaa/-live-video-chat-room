// General notification mechanism from one object to another

/**
   This is an abstract class for which a descendent is declared for every
   function that may be called. The #PDECLARE_NOTIFIER macro makes this
   declaration.

   The #PNotifier and #PNotifierFunction classes build a completely type
   safe mechanism for calling arbitrary member functions on classes. The
   "pointer to a member function" capability built into C++ makes the
   assumption that the function name exists in an ancestor class. If you wish
   to call a member function name that does <b>not</b> exist in any ancestor
   class, very type unsafe casting of the member functions must be made. Some
   compilers will even refuse to do it at all!

   To overcome this problem, as this mechanism is highly desirable for callback
   functions in the GUI part of the PTLib library, these classes and a macro
   are used to create all the classes and declarations to use polymorphism as
   the link between the caller, which has no knowledege of the function, and
   the receiver object and member function.

   This is most often used as the notification of actions being take by
   interactors in the PTLib library.

  The macro is expected to be used inside a class declaration. The class it

  calling the notification function. The \p notifiee parameter is the
  class to which the called member function belongs. Finally the

  declared.
