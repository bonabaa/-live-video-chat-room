   dependent separator character which is defined by the PDIR_SEPARATOR macro.
   The path always has a trailing separator.

   Some platforms allow more than one character to act as a directory separator
   so when doing any processing the #IsSeparator()# function should be
   used to determine if a character is a possible separator.

   The directory may be opened to gain access to the list of files that it
   contains. Note that the directory does {\b not} contain the "." and ".."
   entries that some platforms support.
