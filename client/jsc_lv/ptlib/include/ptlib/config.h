/** A class representing a configuration for the application.
There are four sources of configuration information. The system environment,
a system wide configuration file, an application specific configuration file
or an explicit configuration file.

Configuration information follows a three level hierarchy: <i>file</i>,
<i>section</i> and <i>variable</i>. Thus, a configuration file consists of
a number of sections each with a number of variables selected by a
<i>key</i>. Each variable has an associated value.

Note that the evironment source for configuration information does not have
sections. The section is ignored and the same set of keys are available.

The configuration file is a standard text file for the platform with its
internals appearing in the form:
<code>
     [Section String]
     Key Name=Value String
</code>
