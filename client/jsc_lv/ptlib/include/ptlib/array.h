// The abstract array class

/**This class contains a variable length array of arbitrary memory blocks.
   These can be anything from individual bytes to large structures. Note that
   that does \b not include class objects that require construction or
   destruction. Elements in this array will not execute the contructors or
   destructors of objects.

   An abstract array consists of a linear block of memory sufficient to hold
   PContainer::GetSize() elements of #elementSize bytes
   each. The memory block itself will automatically be resized when required
   and freed when no more references to it are present.

   The PAbstractArray class would very rarely be descended from directly by
   the user. The #PBASEARRAY macro would normally be used to create
   a class and any new classes descended from that. That will instantiate the
   template based on #PBaseArray or directly declare and define a class
   (using inline functions) if templates are not being used.

   The #PBaseArray class or #PBASEARRAY macro will define the correctly
   typed operators for pointer access (operator const T *) and subscript
   access (operator[]).

// Linear array of objects

/** An array of objects.
This class is a collection of objects which are descendents of the
#PObject class. It is implemeted as a dynamic, linear array of
pointers to the objects.

The implementation of an array allows very fast random access to items in
the collection, but has severe penalties for inserting and deleting objects
as all other objects must be moved to accommodate the change.

An array of objects may have "gaps" in it. These are array entries that
contain NULL as the object pointer.

The PArrayObjects class would very rarely be descended from directly by
the user. The #PARRAY macro would normally be used to create a class.
That will instantiate the template based on #PArray or directly declare
and define the class (using inline functions) if templates are not being used.

The #PArray class or #PARRAY macro will define the
correctly typed operators for pointer access (operator const T *) and
subscript access (operator[]).
