/**This class defines a thread mutual exclusion object. A mutex is where a
   piece of code or data cannot be accessed by more than one thread at a time.
   To prevent this the PMutex is used in the following manner:
<code>
      PMutex mutex;

      ...

      mutex.Wait();

      ... critical section - only one thread at a time here.

      mutex.Signal();

      ...
</code>
    The first thread will pass through the #Wait()# function, a second
    thread will block on that function until the first calls the
    #Signal()# function, releasing the second thread.

 * to carry around all of the PSemaphore members
