/** Abstract class defining I/O channel semantics. An I/O channel can be a
   serial port, pipe, network socket or even just a simple file. Anything that
   requires opening and closing then reading and/or writing from.

   A descendent would typically have constructors and an #Open()# function which
   enables access to the I/O channel it represents. The #Read()# and
   #Write()# functions would then be overridden to the platform and I/O
   specific mechanisms required.

   The general model for a channel is that the channel accepts and/or supplies
   a stream of bytes. The access to the stream of bytes is via a set of
   functions that allow certain types of transfer. These include direct
   transfers, buffered transfers (via iostream) or asynchronous transfers.

   The model also has the fundamental state of the channel being <i>open</i>
   or <i>closed</i>. A channel instance that is closed contains sufficient
   information to describe the channel but does not allocate or lock any
   system resources. An open channel allocates or locks the particular system
   resource. The act of opening a channel is a key event that may fail. In this
   case the channel remains closed and error values are set.
