/** This class defines a thread synchronisation object.
  This form of semaphore is used to indicate an <i>event</i> has occurred. A
  thread may block on the sync point and wait until another thread signals
  that it may continue. eg:
\verbatim
    ... thread one
    while (condition) {
      sync.Wait();
      do_something();
    }

    ... thread 2
    do_something_else();
    sync.Signal();    // At this point thread 1 wake up and does something.
    do_yet_more();
\endverbatim

  Note that events are boolean in nature. If "thread one" is not waiting on the
  event, multiple calls to Signal() are ignored, thread one will only exit the
  Wait() call a single time once it gets there. Similarly, if multiple threads
  are waiting on the event, only one thread will be released. As you cannot know
  which thread will be released this mode of use is not recommended.
