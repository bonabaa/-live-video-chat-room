/**
   A class representing a system timer. The time interval ancestor value is
   the amount of time left in the timer.

   A timer on completion calls the virtual function #OnTimeout()#. This
   will in turn call the callback function provided by the instance. The user
   may either override the virtual function or set a callback as desired.
   
   A list of active timers is maintained by the applications #PProcess# 
   instance and the timeout functions are executed in the context of a single
   thread of execution. There are many consequences of this: only one timeout
   function can be executed at a time and thus a user should not execute a
   lot of code in the timeout call-back functions or it will dealy the timely
   execution of other timers call-back functions.

   Also timers are not very accurate in sub-second delays, even though you can
   set the timer in milliseconds, its accuracy is only to -0/+250 ms. Even
   more (potentially MUCH more) if there are delays in the user call-back
   functions.

   Another trap is you cannot destroy a timer in its own call-back. There is
   code to cause an assert if you try but it is very easy to accidentally do
   this when you delete an object that contains an onject that contains the
   timer!

   Finally static timers cause race conditions on start up and termination and
   should be avoided.

       mutex the calling thread already has, so an aysnchronouse version is
