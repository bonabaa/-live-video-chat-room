/**This class defines a thread synchronisation object. This is in the form of a
   integer semaphore. The semaphore has a count and a maximum value. The
   various combinations of count and usage of the Wait() and
   Signal() functions determine the type of synchronisation mechanism
   to be employed.

   The Wait() operation is that if the semaphore count is > 0,
   decrement the semaphore and return. If it is = 0 then wait (block).

   The Signal() operation is that if there are waiting threads then
   unblock the first one that was blocked. If no waiting threads and the count
   is less than the maximum then increment the semaphore.

   The most common is to create a mutual exclusion zone. A mutex is where a
   piece of code or data cannot be accessed by more than one thread at a time.
   To prevent this the PSemaphore is used in the following manner:
\verbatim
      PSemaphore mutex(1, 1);  // Maximum value of 1 and initial value of 1.

      ...

      mutex.Wait();

      ... critical section - only one thread at a time here.

      mutex.Signal();

      ...
\endverbatim
    The first thread will pass through the Wait() function, a second
    thread will block on that function until the first calls the
    Signal() function, releasing the second thread.
