/**This class represents a disk file. This is a particular type of I/O channel
   that has certain attributes. All platforms have a disk file, though exact
   details of naming convertions etc may be different.

   The basic model for files is that they are a named sequence of bytes that
   persists within a directory structure. The transfer of data to and from
   the file is made at a current position in the file. This may be set to
   random locations within the file.
