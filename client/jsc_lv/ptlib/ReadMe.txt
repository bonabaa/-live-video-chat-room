================================================================================

1. Introduction
---------------

PTLib (Portable Tools Library) is a moderately large class library that has it's
genesis many years ago as PWLib (portable Windows Library), a method to product
applications to run on both Microsoft Windows and Unix systems. It has also been
ported to other systems such as Mac OSX, VxWorks and other embedded systems

Since then the system has grown to include many classes that assist in writing
complete multi-platform applications. Classes for I/O portability, multi-
threading portability, aid in producing unix daemons and NT services portably
and all sorts of internet protocols were added over the years. So it became a
Portable Tools Library and was renamed to PTLib.

All this over and above basic "container" classes such as arrays, linear lists,
sorted lists (RB Tree) and dictionaries (hash tables) which were all created
before STL was standardized. Future versions of PTLib will see many of these
classes replaced or supplemented by STL.

The library was used extensively for all our in-house products. Then we decided
to support the Open H323 project by throwing in some of the code written for
one of our products. Thus, required PTLib so it got thrown into the open source
world as well.



================================================================================

2. Apologies (not)
------------------

As you start using the library, the inevitable question "why did they do it that
way?" will come up. The more experienced out there will know that there are
several reasons for the way things are:

   *   Carefully considered design,
   *   Workarounds for portability and compiler subtleties,
   *   History, it may be too hard to change an early design decision,
   *   Complete arbitrariness, the absence of any compelling reason.

So, when you ask the next question "why didn't you do it this way?" The answer
will be one of the above. The last one being a synonym for "we didn't think of
that!"

The bottom line is, use the library as is or change it as you require. You can
even send in suggestions for improvements (or merely changes) and we may (or may
not) include them in the base line code. Just do not send us any mail starting
with the words "Why did you..." as the answer is quite likely to be "Because!"



================================================================================

3. SVN Access
-------------

There is a public SVN archive available at svn.sourceforge.net. To extract, use a
command line like the following:

    cvs -z3 -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/openh323 co module

where "module" is one of the module names specified above.

If you would like see the structure of the CVS, then use the View CVS tool at:

    http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/openh323/


================================================================================

4. Building PTLib
-----------------

This library is multi-platform, however there are only two major build systems
that are used. The Microsoft DevStudio environment for Windows and the GNU make
system for all of the various unix systems.

SPECIAL NOTE FOR MSVC 6 USERS:
------------------------------
If you are using MSVC 6 then please run the "msvc6_upgrade.bat" script in the 
PTLib top directory before continuing. If you skip this step, you will not
be able to compile PTLib on MSVC 6. If you change the build environment to bypass 
this step, then DLL versions of PTLib will not function correctly. For more 
information, please see:

http://www.voxgratia.org/docs/ptlib_windows.html#msvc_headers 


Actually, better yet, UPGRADE YOUR COMPILER!!!!


4.1. For Windows
----------------

Note that more complete instructions can be found at the following URL, but here 
are the basics:

    http://www.voxgratia.org/docs/ptlib_windows.html 

1.  Note you will need the bison and flex tools to compile some parts of the
    system. You can get a copy from http://www.openh323.org/bin/flexbison.zip,
    follow the instructions included in that package and put the executables
    somewhere in your path.

2.  Start DevStudio .NET 2003 or .NET 2005. MSVC v6 may work, but is no longer
    actively supported. If you have another compiler you are on your own! Add
    these directories to the Include Files path as follows:
    
    In VisualStudio v7/8, go into the Tools menu, Options item. In the Options
    dialog, open the Projects folder, VC++ Directories item. In the 'Show
    Directories for:' list, select 'Include files'.
	
		C:\PTLib\Include
		
    Add the following to the Lib Files path and the Executable Files path:
	
		C:\PTLib\Lib
		
    The Lib folder is created as parts of PTLib are built. Also add this
    directory to your PATH environment variable (so the MergeSym tool can 
    be found).

3.  Open the ptlib.sln or ptlib_2005.sln file for DevStudio 2003 or 2005
    respectively.

4.  Select Release mode and build MergeSym.

    The build should automatically create a file ptlib/include/ptbuildopts.h
    via the configure.exe program that should be in the ptlib directory. If
    you have any problems try running the program directly from a command
    line. Use ".\configure --help" to get information on options such as
    forcing a feature or library dependency.

    The above will search the entire hard disk(s) for software packages to
    configure. This may take some time, so a useful feature is to set the
    environment variable:

	PTLIB_CONFIGURE_OPTIONS = --no-search

    which will only search some "standard" locations. Not ethat you could
    also include arguments to set the paths of packages that are not in
    standard locations.

    Note there are additional notes in the "Platform Specific Issues" on how
    to compile the various libraries in a manner suitable for use by PTLib
    under Windows.

5.  You can then build the entire solution for Release, Debug and No Trace
    versions as you require.

5.  That's it, now you're on your own!



These are the project relationships:

project             dependencies                             output
-------             ------------                             ------
Console             (none)                                   ptlibs.lib
MergeSym            ptlibs.lib                               mergesym.exe
PTLib               ptlibs.lib, mergesym.exe                 ptlib.dll & lib
XMLRPC              ptlibs.lib, ptclib.lib                   xmlrpc.exe

Debug versions append 'd' to filename, ie: ptlibsd.lib.

MSDevWizard will not build in VisualStudio v7 and so is not included as a project.



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.2. For unix.
--------------

1.	If you have not put ptlib it into your home directory (~/ptlib) then
	you will have to define the environment variable PTLIBDIR to point to
	the correct directory.

        Also make sure you have added the PTLib lib directory (e.g.
        $PTLIBDIR/lib_linux_x86) to your LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable
        if you intend to use shared libraries (the default).

2.	Build the debug and release versions of the PTLib library as follows:
		cd ~/ptlib
        ./configure
		make
	This may take some time. Note, you will need bison and flex for this to
	compile, most unix systems have these. WARNING: there is a bug in most 
	of the bison.simple files. See below for details.

	PTLib requires GNU Make. If GNU Make (gmake) is not your default make
	program (eg FreeBSD users), you will need to install GNU Make first
	and then use
		cd ~/ptlib
        ./configure
		gmake


	If you are getting huge numbers of errors during the compile, then it 
        is likely your platform is not supported, or you have incorrectly set 
        the OSTYPE and MACHTYPE variables.

3.	That's all there is to it, you are now on your own!



Bison problem under Unix

The bison.simple file on many releases will not compile with the options used 
by the PTLib getdate.y grammar. The options are required to make the date 
parser thread safe so it is necessary to edit the bison.simple file to fix the 
problem.

The file is usually at /usr/lib/bison.simple but in the tradition of unix 
could actually be anywhere. We leave it up to you to find it.

The code:

	/* Prevent warning if -Wstrict-prototypes. */
	#ifdef __GNUC__
	int yyparse (void);
	#endif

should be changed to

	/* Prevent warning if -Wstrict-prototypes. */
	#ifdef __GNUC__
	#ifndef YYPARSE_PARAM
	int yyparse (void);
	#endif
	#endif

To prevent the incorrect function prototype from being defined. The getdate.y 
should then produce a getdate.tab.c file that will actually compile.




================================================================================

5. Using PTLib
--------------

What documentation there is consists of this document and all of the header
files. It was intended that a post processer go through the header files and
produces HTML help files, but this never got completed.


5.1. Tutorial
-------------

Detailed tutorials will almost certainly not be forthcoming. However, at least
giving you an indication on how to start an application would be useful, so
here is the infamous "Hello world!" program.


// hello.cxx

#include <ptlib.h>

class Hello : public PProcess
{
  PCLASSINFO(Hello, PProcess)
  public:
    void Main();
};

PCREATE_PROCESS(Hello)

void Hello::Main()
{
  cout << "Hello world!\n";
}

// End of hello.cxx


The CREATE_PROCESS macro actually defines the main() function and creates an
instance of Hello. This assures that everything is initialised in the correct
order. C++ does initialisation of global statics badly (and destruction is even
worse), so try to put everything into your PProcess descedent rather than
globals.

A GUI application is very similar but is descended off PApplication rather than
PProcess, and would create a window as a descendent off the PMainWindow class.

The following is a simple Makefile for Unix platforms for the hello world 
program.


# Simple makefile for PTLib

PROG    = hello
SOURCES = hello.cxx

ifndef PTLIBDIR
PTLIBDIR=$(HOME)/ptlib
endif

include $(PTLIBDIR)/make/ptlib.mak

# End of Makefile



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.2. PTlib Classes
------------------

The classes in PTLib fall into the following broad categories

	Containers
	I/O
	Threads & Processes


5.2.1. Containers

While there are a number of container classes you wourld rarely actually descend
off them, you would use macros that declare type safe descendents. These are
simply templates instantiations when using a compiler that supports templates
in a simple manner (GNU C++ does not qualify in our opinion).

5.2.2. I/O

There are many classes descendend from a basic primitive call a PChannel, which
represents an entity for doing I/O. There are classes for files, serial ports,
various types of socket and pipes to sub-processes.

5.2.3. Threads & Processes

These classes support lightweight threading and functionality to do with the
process as a whole (for example argument parsing). The threading will be
pre-emptive on platforms that support it (Win32, platforms with pthreads eg
Linux and FreeBSD) and cooperative on those that don't.




================================================================================

6. IPv6 support in ptlib
------------------------

The IPv6 support in PTlib is supported and can be enabled or disabled via
the configure program.

When compiled with the IPv6 support, applications using only IPv4 are still 
fully backward compatible. PTLib is able to manage simultaneously IPv4 and
IPv6 connections.



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6.1. Windows platforms
----------------------

According to microsoft, IPv6 is not supported under 9x, experimental on Win2000, 
supported on XP.
You must use a compiler with IPv6 aware includes and libraries:
  - VC6 must be patched to support RFC 2553 structure. (See 7.1 and 7.2 for patch)
  - .Net should be ok (to be confirmed)
The port as been performed with VC6 patched on a win2000 platform.

For more informations about IPv6 support:
  Microsoft IPv6 support: 
    http://research.microsoft.com/msripv6/
  IPv6 for win2000: 
    http://msdn.microsoft.com/downloads/sdks/platform/tpipv6.asp
  IPv6 for XP: 
    http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/pro/techinfo/administration/ipv6/default.asp



6.1.1. Windows platforms: Win2000
---------------------------------
Go to Microsoft win2000 IPv6 tech preview web page.
http://msdn.microsoft.com/downloads/sdks/platform/tpipv6.asp
Download the 'tpipv6-001205.exe' file and read carrefully the faq.
http://msdn.microsoft.com/downloads/sdks/platform/tpipv6/faq.asp

This program is designed for win2000 English Service pack 1.
To install it on newer Service pack, you have to modify some files.
Again, read the Faq.
 
This install the IPv6 driver and the IPv6 includes.



6.1.2. Windows platforms: XP
----------------------------
Read the IPv6 faq for windows XP
http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/pro/techinfo/administration/ipv6/default.asp

The 'ipv6 install' command installs only the IPv6 drivers.
You need to install additionnals IPv6 includes for VC6.
.NET should be ready. (to be confirmed ....)



6.1.3. Compiling
----------------
To compile ptlib and openh323 with the IPv6 support you have to set an 
environment variable:
IPV6FLAG=1
Set it using: [Start]/[Configuration pannel]/[System]/[Environment]

Add the IPv6 SDK include path in your Visual C++ 6 environment:
[Tools]/[Options]/[Directories]/[Include files]



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6.2. Linux platforms
--------------------

Recent Linux distributions support IPv6.
2.4 kernels are IPv6 aware.

Linux IPv6 Faq:
http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Linux+IPv6-HOWTO/



6.2.1. Enabling IPv6 support
----------------------------
IPv6 can be compiled statically in the kernel or compiled as a module.
To load the IPv6 module, as 'root'
#modprobe ipv6



6.2.2. Compiling
--------------
Check that IPv6 is really on
#ls /proc/net/if_inet6
If this file exists, then IPv6 support is compiled in ptlib and openh323.



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6.3. Testing
------------

The test application sources can be found in the directory: openh323/samples/simple
Once compiled the binaries are in simple/debug, release, obj_linux_x86_d, or
obj_linux_x86_r.
Under windows, the test application is simple.exe
Under linux, the test application is simh323
IPv6 support can be tested on only one machine. Just open two shell/command windows.



6.3.1. IPv6 Address and port notation
-------------------------------------
IPv4 address and port are written in dot notation: xx.xx.xx.xx:4000
IPv6 global address are written in semi-colon notation: [xx:xx:xx:xx::xx]:4000
IPv6 scoped address ad a field for the scope: [xx:xx:xx:xx::xx%scope]:4000

Exemples:
Global address
[3ffe:0b80:0002:f9c1:0000:0000:500b:0ea5]:4000
[3ffe:0b80:0002:f9c1::500b:0ea5]:4000

Scoped address
[fe80::232:56ff:fe95:315%lnc0]:4000
Scoped address are not supported yet.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6.4. Known limitations
--------------------

You must use IPv6 address with global scope. Tests with IPv6 local link address
fail.



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6.5. Questions
--------------

6.5.1. How to patch my VC6 includes files ?
-----------------------------------------

To patch you Developper studio Visual C++ version 6, just edit the file
"C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\VC98\Include\ws2tcpip.h", and add
the sin6_scope_id field in the sockadd_in6 structure.
struct sockaddr_in6 {
          short     sin6_family;         /* AF_INET6 */
          u_short sin6_port;  /* Transport level port number */
          u_long    sin6_flowinfo; /* IPv6 flow information */
          struct in_addr6 sin6_addr; /* IPv6 address */
          u_long    sin6_scope_id; /* scope id (new in RFC2553) */ <--- Add this one
};

This may have an impact on you system stability, use it only on
experimental platforms. Using .NET compiler should be a better solution.



6.5.2. Why do I need to modify my Visual C++6 include files ? 
-----------------------------------------------------------

Visual Studio C++ version 6 implements the old RFC 2133 in file "ws2tcpip.h".
RFC 2133 defines a 24 byte sockaddr_in6 structure.
struct sockaddr_in6 {
          short     sin6_family;         /* AF_INET6 */
          u_short sin6_port;  /* Transport level port number */
          u_long    sin6_flowinfo; /* IPv6 flow information */
          struct in_addr6 sin6_addr; /* IPv6 address */
};


This RFC as been replaced by RFC 2553.
RFC 2133 defines a 28 byte addsock_in6 structure.
struct sockaddr_in6 {
          short     sin6_family;         /* AF_INET6 */
          u_short sin6_port;  /* Transport level port number */
          u_long    sin6_flowinfo; /* IPv6 flow information */
          struct in_addr6 sin6_addr; /* IPv6 address */
          u_long    sin6_scope_id; /* scope id (new in RFC2553) */
};



6.5.3. How to get an ipv6 address with a Global scope ?
-----------------------------------------------------

6.5.3.1. Manually
-----------------

Set one manually if you're not connected to IPv4 Internet or IPv6 backbone:
#ip -6 addr add 3ffe:0b80:0002:f9c1:0000:0000:500b:0ea5 dev eth0
(this address is owned by freenet6.net).

Check the address is set.
#ifconfig
eth0      Lien encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 00:08:D5:10:C7:BB
          inet adr:12.0.0.2  Bcast:12.255.255.255  Masque:255.0.0.0
          adr inet6: 3ffe:b80:2:f9c1::500b:ea5/128 Scope:Global  <- - - Ok, Global scope
          adr inet6: fe80::208:c7ff:fe59:bbc7/10 Scope:Lien <- - - [ Can't use this one ]
          UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1
          RX packets:0 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0
          TX packets:9 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:9 carrier:0
          collisions:0
          RX bytes:0 (0.0 b)  TX bytes:534 (534.0 b)


6.5.3.2. Tunnel broker
----------------------

Get one from a free IPv6 tunnel broker.
Exemple: 
http://www.freenet6.net : Canadian tunnel broker
http://tb.ngnet.it      : Italian tunnel broker (Telecom Italia Research)


Note: The current (10/2002) freenet6 windows binary is buggy, use it to get the 
values, and set manually your tunnel.



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6.6. Troubles
------------

6.6.1. Listen on ::1:1720 failed: Address family not supported by protocol
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
IPv6 module is not loaded in the kernel.
#modprobe ipv6



6.6.2. SimpleH323	TCP Could not open H.323 listener port on 1720
--------------------------------------------------------------
Add some traces: -t on the command line. 



6.6.3. SimpleH323	TCP Listen on fe80::2b0:d0ff:fedf:d6bf:1720 failed: Invalid argument
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This address is a local scope address. As the scope_id field is always set to 0,
its value is invalid.

Use address with global scope.




================================================================================

7. Platform Specific Issues
---------------------------
PTLib has been ported to several platforms. However on some systems not all of
the functionality has been implemented. This could be due to lack of support
at the OS level or simply due to lack of time or documentation when developing
the port.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7.1. FreeBSD Issues
-------------------

Port Maintained by Roger Hardiman <roger@freebsd.org>
GetRouteTable() in socket.cxx has been added. It is used by
OenH323Proxy, but is not fully tested.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7.2. OpenBSD Issues
-------------------

Port Maintained by Roger Hardiman <roger@freebsd.org>
GetRouteTable() in socket.cxx has been added. It is used by
OenH323Proxy, but is not fully tested.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7.3. NetBSD Issues
------------------

Port Maintained by Roger Hardiman <roger@freebsd.org>
GetRouteTable() in socket.cxx has been added. It is used by
OenH323Proxy, but is not fully tested.

There are now three ways to do pthreads in NetBSD.
a) unproven threads - from the packages tree.
b) GNU pth threads - from the packages tree.
c) Native pthreads - added to the kernel on 15th January 2003.

The choice can be made by editing ptlib/make/unix.mak
Native threads is the default and the best solution.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7.4. Mac OS X (Darwin) Issues
-----------------------------

Port maintained by Roger Hardiman <roger@freebsd.org> but recently
Shawn Pai-Hsiang Hsiao <shawn@eecs.harvard.edu> has been leading
development.
Threads cannot be suspended once they are running, and trying to Suspend
a running thread will generate an Assertion Error.
Theads can be created in 'suspended' mode and then started with Resume
This is due to a lack of pthread_kill() in Dawrin 1.2
See http://www.publicsource.apple.com/bugs/X/Libraries/2686231.html

GetRouteTable() in socket.cxx has been added. It is used by
OenH323Proxy, but is not fully tested.

localtime_r() and gm_time() are missing.
So in osutil.cxx I have implemented os_localtime() and os_gmtime()
with localtime() and gm_time() which may not be thread safe.

There is also no implementation for dynamic library functions.

Audio is supported using the coreaudio library.

Video support is being added by Shawn and users interested in this should
check Shawn's web site at http://sourceforge.net/projects/xmeeting/

7.5. BeOS Issues
----------------

Port Maintained by Yuri Kiryanov <openh323@kiryanov.com>. 
Current version supported is BeOS 5.0.2. 

Most important issue is lack of variable sample frequency from system sound producer node.
I made quite a few attempts to implement sound resampler in code, 
even with help of Be engineers, but eventually decided to wait until new Media Kit
with resampler built-in. 
Also network code needed more things, as OOB, which was promised in BONE. 
BONE will allow to make less #defines in network code as well.
As update will hit the Net, I'll get back to it ASAP.

7.6. Windows CE Issues
----------------------

There is a very old port that was maintained by Yuri Kiryanov <openh323@kiryanov.com>. 
for 2.x and 3.x (PocketPC). But this is no longer supported. You are on your own.
Look for more port-related info on http://www.pocketbone.com

For Windows Mobile 5 and Windows Mobile 6 these are supoported via DevStudio 2005,
just follow the normal isntractions for Windows builds.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7.7. Solaris Issues
-------------------
On Solaris 8, you need to install GNU Ld (the loader) to get
shared libraries to compile. (otherwise there is an error with -soname)
You can get around this by using the static libraries and
compiling with make optnoshared and make debugnoshared

There is currently no implementation of GetRouteTable() in socket.cxx
so OpenH323Proxy will not work.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7.8. Build libraries under Windows
----------------------------------

Unfortunately building libraries that were intended for Unix based systems
under Windows can sometimes be difficult. Here are some notes on the subsystems
that PTLib uses.

7.8.1. OpenSSL under Windows
----------------------------
The standard build for OpenSSL off http://www.openssl.org does work though it
is rather tricky and requires things like Perl to be installed on your
Windows box. However the build does work and is correct for PTlib use. Make
sure you build the non-DLL Debug and Release versions.

7.8.2. EXPAT under Windows
---------------------------
The easiest way is to get the one in the OpenH323 CVS. This is guranteed to
work. Use the following command to do this:

  cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/openh323 co external/expat

and then use the expat.dsw file to build the Debug and Release libraries.

7.8.3. OpenLDAP under Windows
---------------------------
To use OpenLDAP with PTLib you have to compile the OpenLDAP library as a DLL.
Unfortunately, the standard distribution does not do this. So there is a file in
PTLib called ptlib/tools/openldap-2.1.12-win32.zip which contains altered build
files for that version of OpenLDAP. Note if you have a different version these
files may not work.

To build the DLL:

   1   Get OpenLDAP v 2.1.17 via tar file at
         ftp://ftp.openldap.org/pub/OpenLDAP/openldap-release/openldap-2.1.17.tgz
       or anonymous CVS using tag at
         :pserver:anonymous@cvs.OpenLDAP.org:/repo/OpenLDAP
       using tag OPENLDAP_REL_ENG_2_1_17
   2   Unpack it somewhere, eg c:\work\openldap
   3   Unzip the openldap-2.1.17-win32.zip file that directory
   4   Open openldap/build/main.dsw
   5   use Batch build to and select the "dll" project and build the "DLL Debug"
       and "DLL Release" targets.
   6   Put the resulting openldap/DLLRelease/openldap.dll and
       openldap/DLLDebug/openldapd.dll files in your path.

7.8.4 SDL under Windows
-----------------------
Version 1.2.5 has support for Windows and MSVC so you just need to download it
from http://www.libsdl.org/ and follow the build instructions.

7.8.5 SASL under Windows
------------------------
The standard distribution of Cyrus SASL comes with makefiles for Windows and
clear instructions on how to build the library. The current implementation
in PTLib was tested with Cyrus SASL version 2.1.18. Tarballs can be downloaded
from:

    http://asg.web.cmu.edu/sasl/sasl-library.html


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7.9. ESD (Esound)
-----------------

Most targets come with native sound support.
However there is also support for the ESD (esound) daemon which provides
full duplex audio via network sockets.
To compile ptlib to use ESD, you need to set the ESDDIR environment variable
to point to the directory you have installed ESD into.
Then compile ptlib.

8. Conclusion
-------------

This package is far from a "product". There is very limited documentation and
support will be on an ad-hoc basis, send us an e-mail and we will probably
answer your question if it isn't too difficult.

It is supplied mainly to support the open H323 project, but that shouldn't stop
you from using it in whatever project you have in mind if you so desire. We like
it and use it all the time, and we don't want to get into any religious wars of
this class library over that one.

9. Licensing                 
------------

The bulk of this library is licensed under the MPL (Mozilla Public License)
version 1.0. In simple terms this license allows you to use the library for 
any purpose, commercial or otherwise, provided the library is kept in tact
as a separate entity and any changes made to the library are made publicly
available under the same (MPL) license. It is important to realise that that 
refers to changes to the library and not your application that is merely 
linked to the library.

Note that due to a restriction in the GPL, any application you write that 
uses anything another than GPL, eg our library with MPL, is technically in
breach of the GPL license. However, it should be noted that MPL does not
care about the license of the final application, and as only the author of
the GPL application is in breach of his own license and is unlikely to sue
themselves for that breach, in practice there is no problem with a GPL 
application using an MPL or any other commercial library.
