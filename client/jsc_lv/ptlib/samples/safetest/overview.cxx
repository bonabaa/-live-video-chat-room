/*! \mainpage Thread safe test of PSafeXXX

\section secOverview Overview

     An application to test the operation of the methods in the
     PSafeXXX structures of Pwlib. Specifically, we examine
     PSafeObject, PSafeDictionary, PSafePtr.

     In addition, we examine the PThread structure, because hundreds
     of PThread instances are are created/destroyed every minute.

\section secClassListings Description of the classes in this application
The following classes are to be found in this application.
\li SafeTest - the parent class of everything, which is descended from 
     PProcess, and contains the dictionary being tested.
\li DelayThread - the worker class, is descended from PSafeObject, and is 
    placed in the dictionary being tested
\li UserInterfaceThread - waits for keyboard input and responds appropriately
\li LauncherThread - creates instances of the DelayThread class
\section secArchitecture Architecture 

The DelayThread class is the "worker bee" class in this
application. Hundreds, or indeed millions of instances of this class
will be created and destroyed. Each DelayThread instance is descended from 
 PSafeObject and does the following things
 \li create an AutoDeletedThread to 
 \li appends this DelayThread instance to a dictionary
 \li sleep for the user defined  number of milliseconds
 \li create an AutoDeletedThread to remove this DelayThread 
     instance from the dictionary.

There are several threads of execution in this program

\li Launcher thread, which runs in the class LauncherThread. There is
   one instance of this thread, which runs in a busy loop fashion to
   create DelayThread instances. This launcher thread will create
   DelayThread instances when the internal counter of the number of
   instances falls below a user defined values.
\li UserInterface thread, which runs in the class
    UserInterfaceThread. This reads input from the console, and will
    report on the progress, (number of iterations, average delay
    period etc) and will end the program on request.
\li Garbage collection thread, which runs inside several methods of
    the SafeTest class. It follows the examples in pwlib of repeatedly
    calling the method dictionary.DelateObjectsToBeDeleted. It
    deviates from these examples by having no delay between calling
    the DeleteObjects method.

This program is ideally run on a multi processor machine. When run,
you will see two threads are consuming 100% of the cpu time, and that
there are several other threads that just "come and go". The idea is
that after some time we expect it to be running just as at the
beginning. No thread will stop with an error condition, and the user
interface will still behave as expected.
