	* [r20617] src/ptlib/common/pluginmgr.cxx:
	  Include current directory in Windows Mobile plug in directory
	  search.

2008-07-10 05:55  rjongbloed

	* [r20559] src/ptlib/common/osutils.cxx,
	  src/ptlib/common/pchannel.cxx:
	  Fixed some Windows Mobile compatibility issues with logging, no
	  "text" mode on files, not properly cleaned up and the big one
	  where the standard C open() function can return a negative number
	  as a valid file handle. Have to explicitly look for os_handle ==
	  -1 rather than os_handle < 0 for error.

2008-06-23 04:14  rjongbloed

	* [r20482] src/ptlib/msos/PTLib_2005.vcproj:
	  Fixed deployment directory for MobileOPAL

2008-06-19 02:36  rjongbloed

	* [r20468] include/ptlib/msos/ptlib/sound_directsound.h,
	  src/ptlib/common/pluginmgr.cxx,
	  src/ptlib/msos/sound_directsound.cxx,
	  src/ptlib/msos/sound_win32.cxx:
	  Fixed issue with WindowMultimedia and DirectSound device names
	  not being identical, which as they are the same device they
	  should be. Making them identical means they then get the driver
	  type prefix making it easier (possible) for a user to distinguish
	  between them.
	  
	  Also cleaned up the enumeration code in DirectSound.

2008-06-18 06:10  rjongbloed

	* [r20464] make/unix.mak:
	  Attempt to make SUSE packager happy making the lib name same as
	  package
	  name (both ptlib).

2008-06-18 06:09  rjongbloed

	* [r20463] src/ptclib/sockagg.cxx:
	  Fixed namespace for find function, possible reason for some
	  compiler issues with it.

2008-06-05 06:06  rjongbloed

	* [r20404] include/ptlib/ipsock.h, src/ptclib/pstun.cxx,
	  src/ptlib/common/sockets.cxx:
	  Due to some particularly bizarre behaviour by Windows Mobile, the
	  gethostbyname() call was changed to use getaddrinfo().
	  Documentation says gethostbyname() is deprecated and should not
	  be used. It appears so as get phantom NO_DATA errors from it when
	  the DNS name well and truly exists.
	  
	  Also improved some error logging.

2008-05-07 00:46  rjongbloed

	* [r20203] version.h:
	  Update version number for beta v2.2.2

2008-05-07 00:45  rjongbloed

	  Update release version number to 2.2.1

2008-05-02 05:29  rjongbloed

	* [r20155] src/ptlib/msos/PTLib_2005.vcproj:
	  Fixed WINCE deployment directory for release version

2008-04-28 23:16  rjongbloed

	* [r20139] include/ptlib/notifier.h:
	  Updated documentation, thanks Stefano Sabatini

	  include/ptlib/msos/ptlibd_2003.dtf,
	  include/ptlib/msos/ptlibn_2003.dtf, ptlib_2003.sln:
	  Updated DLL symbols

	  include/ptlib/msos/ptlibn_2005_wm.dtf,
	  include/ptlib/msos/ptlibn_2005_wm6.dtf:
	  Update symbols

2008-04-24 11:31  rjongbloed

	* [r20104] tools/MergeSym/MergeSym.cxx:
	  Adjustment to MergeSym so predefined named symbols (i.e. ones
	  without a NONAME keyword) in the DTF file are not removed from
	  the DEF file.

2008-04-17 03:25  rjongbloed

	* [r20001] configure, configure.ac, include/ptlib/pprocess.h,
	  src/ptlib/unix/assert.cxx, src/ptlib/unix/svcproc.cxx,
	  src/ptlib/unix/tlibthrd.cxx:
	  Fixed compile without tracing. Now a configure option
	  --disable-tracing
	  which will disable tracing for PTLib and all libraries and
	  applications
	  that use it.

2008-04-14 23:53  rjongbloed

	* [r19991] src/ptclib/url.cxx:
	  Fixed setting of Query vars and parameters via string, should
	  clear out the old dictionary.

2008-04-14 13:05  rjongbloed

	* [r19989] src/ptclib/url.cxx:
	  A SIP URL can, in fact, have Query parameters.

2008-04-14 11:36  rjongbloed

	* [r19987] src/ptclib/pstun.cxx:
	  Fixed crash if timeout contacting STUN server.

2008-04-13 10:28  rjongbloed

	* [r19983] src/ptclib/pstun.cxx:
	  Fixed STUN operating on a single interface.

2008-04-09 04:14  rjongbloed

	* [r19945] include/ptclib/podbc.h,
	  include/ptlib/unix/ptlib/contain.h, src/ptclib/podbc.cxx:
	  Fixed problem with sql.h inclusion conflicting on "Windows" style
	  types.
	  Better fix than the last one which might cause problems on Linux
	  64 bit
	  builds. Primarily included so that we can compile with wxWindows
	  on
	  Linux.

2008-04-09 01:09  rjongbloed

	* [r19942] src/ptclib/pstun.cxx:
	  Fixed STUN issue on Linux after changed to determine the
	  interface that
	  the STUN server can be contacted on. Linux has a problem with
	  even
	  TRYING to do so on the loopback interface. Can safely ignore the
	  loopback interface as the STUN server is unlikely to be there!

2008-04-08 06:23  rjongbloed

	* [r19931] include/ptclib/pnat.h, include/ptclib/pstun.h,
	  src/ptclib/pstun.cxx:
	  Changed STUN so can only operate on a single interface. This
	  avoids problems on multi-homed systems where attempts are made to
	  use STUN on an interface that the STUN server is inaccessible.
	  
	  Added function determine of STUN can be used for a specific local
	  interface.
	  
	  Cleaned up some API names.

2008-04-06 05:55  rjongbloed

	* [r19923] src/ptclib/psasl.cxx:
	  Applied patch to fix SASL usage, thanks Clemens Fischer.

2008-04-01 23:49  rjongbloed

	* [r19882] src/ptlib/msos/ethsock.cxx:
	  Fixed socket get interfaces function so does not return
	  interfaces which do not have a bound IP address, this should not
	  be regarded as an "up" interface.

2008-03-31 01:07  rjongbloed

	* [r19844] include/ptlib/thread.h, src/ptlib/common/osutils.cxx,
	  src/ptlib/msos/svcproc.cxx:
	  Some more changes to the thread name saga, use same format of
	  thread ID display for threads not created by PTLib. Thanks Yuriy
	  Cherniavsky.

2008-03-28 06:01  rjongbloed

	* [r19834] src/ptlib/unix/tlibthrd.cxx:
	  Applied patch for yet another mutex issue for the thread name,
	  this one under Linux only, thanks Tamas

2008-03-28 05:52  rjongbloed

	* [r19832] src/ptlib/common/osutils.cxx:
	  Closed another mutexing issue around the thread name member
	  variable.

2008-03-27 02:53  rjongbloed

	* [r19820] src/ptclib/pwavfiledev.cxx:
	  Fixed incorrect bytes read being returned when resampling a WAV
	  file on the fly in the WAV file sound device.

2008-03-25 13:27  csoutheren

	* [r19808] include/ptlib/thread.h, src/ptlib/common/osutils.cxx:
	  Add mutex to SetThreadName to prevent crashes on Linux

2008-03-25 01:41  rjongbloed

	* [r19797] src/ptlib/unix/svcproc.cxx:
	  Fixed bug about relative ini filepath for svcproc instances under
	  Unix. Thanks Tuyan Ozipek

2008-03-25 01:29  rjongbloed

	* [r19793] include/ptlib/thread.h, src/ptclib/httpsvc.cxx,
	  src/ptclib/pxml.cxx, src/ptclib/snmpserv.cxx,
	  src/ptclib/sockagg.cxx, src/ptclib/vsdl.cxx, src/ptclib/vxml.cxx,
	  src/ptclib/xmpp.cxx, src/ptlib/common/osutils.cxx,
	  src/ptlib/msos/vfw.cxx:
	  Further improvement to the thread name string. Now displays the
	  thread ID on all threads, not requiring the caller to put a %u or
	  %x in it's name. This allows the base code to take into account
	  the platform to display the thread ID in a format suitable for
	  the range of values for the platform, e.g. a decimal number for
	  Win32 and a hex number of Linux.

2008-03-20 03:13  rjongbloed

	* [r19791] include/ptclib/pwavfiledev.h,
	  src/ptclib/pwavfiledev.cxx:
	  Fixed WAV file sound device so correctly handles reads from WAV
	  files that do not happen to be exactly divisible by the number of
	  frames of audio needed by a codec, eg 20ms GSM. Returned
	  insufficient data at the end of file and the codec usually barfs.
	  This is especially a problem when doing auto-rewind on the WAV
	  file.

2008-03-19 01:21  rjongbloed

	* [r19784] include/ptclib/pwavfiledev.h,
	  src/ptclib/pwavfiledev.cxx:
	  Added ability to resample a WAV file on the fly if require
	  different sample rate than that which is provided by the file.

2008-03-18 23:04  rjongbloed

	* [r19778] src/ptlib/common/osutils.cxx:
	  Fixed unix compatibility in last change

2008-03-18 22:55  rjongbloed

	* [r19774] src/ptclib/httpsvc.cxx, src/ptclib/vsdl.cxx,
	  src/ptlib/common/osutils.cxx, src/ptlib/msos/vfw.cxx:
	  Changed thread name to use thread ID (in decimal) as this is more
	  useful for linking up the thread in the debugger with the trace
	  log lines.

2008-03-18 02:58  rjongbloed

	* [r19764] src/ptlib/common/osutils.cxx:
	  Made PTLib more forgiving if someone forgets to call
	  PreInitialise() on the PProcess so there is no argv.

2008-03-17 04:06  rjongbloed

	* [r19759] src/ptlib/common/osutils.cxx:
	  Fixed Unix compatibility

2008-03-17 02:55  rjongbloed

	* [r19756] include/ptlib/syncthrd.h, src/ptlib/common/osutils.cxx:
	  Attempt to fix of crash on shut down of OpalMediaPatch described
	  by Yuriy Cherniavsky.

2008-03-16 22:43  rjongbloed

	* [r19754] configure, configure.ac,
	  include/ptlib/unix/ptlib/pmachdep.h, src/ptclib/pssl.cxx,
	  src/ptlib/unix/maccoreaudio/circular_buffer.inl,
	  src/ptlib/unix/tlibthrd.cxx:
	  Back port from trunk.
	  
	  fix compilation on Mac OS X 10.5
	  
	  fix Darwin OSRELEASE parsing to ensure newer OS versions always
	  get a higher OSRELEASE value

2008-03-11 09:22  rjongbloed

	* [r19722] src/ptlib/common/osutils.cxx:
	  No need to stop a timer that is already stopped

2008-03-10 06:22  rjongbloed

	* [r19704] src/ptlib/common/pluginmgr.cxx:
	  Moved plug ins directory for Windows Mobile from
	  "\Windows\Plugins" to "\Program Files\PTLib Plug Ins", as this
	  that directory is where all user installed stuff should go.

2008-03-07 07:30  rjongbloed

	* [r19696] version.h:
	  Update version number for beta v2.2.1
