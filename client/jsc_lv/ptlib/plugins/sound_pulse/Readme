Pulse Audio plugin

This pulse audio plugin is designed to provide a an
easy path to utilise the most recent audio daemon provided
on linux boxes.

The code in this plugin is very basic, and utilises the simple
interface provided by the pulse sound daemon.

At the time of writing, no sound volume features have been
provided. The pulse audio model is such that the user is expected to
alter the volume level for rec&play using the generic controls on the
desktop.


Information for developers..
The simplest way to know that ptlib has loaded this plugin is to use the 
ptlib test application for audio.  In the directory ptlib/samples/audio,
build this using make opt and run it.
In the following example, we get the audio tool to report the available 
sound devices with the -r option.

./obj_linux_x86_64/audio -r
  0:00.059                        audio                 (0)             Version 1.0alpha0

Audio Test Program

List of play devices
  "Default"
  "*.wav"
  "ptlib pulse plugin"               <<<<<<<< pulse plugin loaded
  "NVidia CK804"
  "NVidia CK804 (1)"
The default play device is "Default"
List of Record devices
  "Default"
  "*.wav"
  "ptlib pulse plugin"               <<<<<<<< pulse plugin loaded
  "NVidia CK804"
  "NVidia CK804 (1)"
The default record device is "Default"

Play volume is (for Default)100
Record volume is (for Default)0


From the above list, we see
the names of the various default sound devices
the alsa names of the sound devices on  video card 
  (the box has dual monitors, so two sound devices are reported)
 the pulse plugin has loaded 

We can do a full duplex sound test.

./obj_linux_x86_64/audio  -f -s ptlib\ pulse\ plugin
  0:00.058                        audio                 (0)             
Version 1.0alpha0 by Roger Hardiman & Derek Smithies code factory on Unix Linux 
(2.6.24-23-generic-x86_64) with PTLib (v2.7beta0) at 2009/3/4 10:06:56.083

Audio Test Program

Play volume is (for ptlib pulse plugin)32767
Record volume is (for ptlib pulse plugin)32767
(testing sound device for full duplex) Command ?    

at this stage, there is a read and write thread active, reading from
mic, putting audio into a buffer, and then playing the audio to the
speaker. You can do h for help and see the different options. Sound is
processed in chunks that are 30ms long.

If you go to the desktop, and look at the pulse audio manager. There are two
clients in the list, "pulserec" and "pulseplay". These two clients are from
the pulse plugin code.

Enjoy,
