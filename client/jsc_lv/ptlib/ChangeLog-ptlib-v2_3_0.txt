	  Further improvement to the thread name string. Now displays the

	  %x in it's name. This allows the base code to take into account
	  the platform to display the thread ID in a format suitable for
	  the range of values for the platform, e.g. a decimal number for
	  Win32 and a hex number of Linux.

	* [r20346] include/ptbuildopts.h.in, src/ptlib/msos/win32.cxx:
	  Added WinCE 5+ COM support

2008-05-31 02:55  shorne

	* [r20347] include/ptbuildopts.h.in:
	  Fix small COM define error

2008-06-02 00:36  csoutheren

	* [r20359] configure, configure.ac, include/ptbuildopts.h.in,
	  src/ptlib/common/jidctflt.cxx:
	  Add support for LPIA

2008-06-03 02:23  rjongbloed

	* [r20365] include/ptclib/pnat.h, include/ptclib/psockbun.h,
	  include/ptclib/pstun.h, src/ptclib/pnat.cxx,
	  src/ptclib/psockbun.cxx, src/ptclib/pstun.cxx:
	  Moved a number of STUN functions up into abstract base class
	  PNatMethod. Cleaned up some of the functions and changed names to
	  make easier their move to virtual.
	  
	  Changed socket bundling code to use NAT method abstract class
	  rather than STUN concrete class.
	  
	  Warning! This may cause some API breakage for direct users of
	  PNatMethod/PSTUNClient.

2008-06-03 11:18  rjongbloed

	* [r20372] src/ptlib/common/sockets.cxx:
	  Changed test for loopback address to just looking at 127.x.x.x
	  rather than explicitly 127.0.0.1 due to some very bizarre systems
	  out there.

2008-06-04 01:54  rjongbloed

	* [r20375] make/common.mak:
	  Fixed odd dependency generation if do not have any dependency
	  files yet.

	* [r20386] configure, configure.ac:
	  Fixed configure so --enable-tracing actually enables it and
	  doesn't
	  disable it, which is a tad confusing.

	* [r20405] include/ptlib/ipsock.h, src/ptclib/pstun.cxx,
	  src/ptlib/common/sockets.cxx:
	  Due to some particularly bizarre behaviour by Windows Mobile, the
	  gethostbyname() call was changed to use getaddrinfo().
	  Documentation says gethostbyname() is deprecated and should not
	  be used. It appears so as get phantom NO_DATA errors from it when
	  the DNS name well and truly exists.
	  
	  Also improved some error logging.

	* [r20409] include/ptclib/podbc.h, src/ptclib/podbc.cxx:
	  Attempted fix for bug [ 1966564 ] ptlib trunk fails to compile on
	  64bit debian architectures from Schoinobates Volans

2008-06-06 02:09  rjongbloed

	* [r20414] src/ptlib/common/contain.cxx:
	  Fixed subtle bug with reading strings from streams. A call to
	  get() that returns EOF also sets the "bad" bit in the stream
	  when, at least for strings, the read was not actually bad.
	  Changed so now only returns the eof bit which is what you would
	  expect.

	  Enabled HTTP service code for Windows Mobile + made wchar_t type
	  not treated as built-in type.

	  src/ptlib/common/pluginmgr.cxx,
	  src/ptlib/msos/sound_directsound.cxx,
	  src/ptlib/msos/sound_win32.cxx:
	  Fixed issue with WindowMultimedia and DirectSound device names
	  not being identical, which as they are the same device they
	  should be. Making them identical means they then get the driver
	  type prefix making it easier (possible) for a user to distinguish
	  between them.
	  
	  Also cleaned up the enumeration code in DirectSound.

2008-06-20 03:34  csoutheren

	* [r20475] configure, configure.ac:
	  Ensure configure uses standard file extension for trial compiles

2008-06-26 12:52  shorne

	* [r20503] include/ptclib/pldap.h, src/ptclib/pldap.cxx:
	  Changed PList to PArray to fix break in H.350 code in h323plus

2008-06-28 03:19  shorne

	* [r20510] src/ptlib/unix/config.cxx:
	  Applied Patch 1699798 (OpenH323) zvision to fix issue with
	  PConfig Dictionary not removing a config prior to applying new
	  config resulting in the old config still being used.

2008-07-03 09:08  rjongbloed

	* [r20531] src/ptlib/msos/sound_win32.cxx:
	  Put back the actual waveOutClose()/waveInClose() of the windows

2008-07-10 05:57  rjongbloed

	* [r20560] src/ptlib/common/osutils.cxx,
	  src/ptlib/common/pchannel.cxx:
	  Fixed some Windows Mobile compatibility issues with logging, no
	  "text" mode on files, not properly cleaned up and the big one
	  where the standard C open() function can return a negative number
	  as a valid file handle. Have to explicitly look for os_handle ==
	  -1 rather than os_handle < 0 for error.

2008-07-11 09:19  rjongbloed

	* [r20565] include/ptlib/sound.h,
	  src/ptlib/msos/sound_directsound.cxx,

	  Clarified the operation of the PSoundChannel::SetVolume function
