There is minor chance to evoke this bug, but it might be replayed sometimes if the network communication is very busy.
Now fixed by changing to strict mutex.

2) add call between domains;
3) when channel setup, the peer domain id can be accessed as BBQ_CHANNEL::info.peerServerId;

2005.12.15
---------------------------------
*) bbqsvr.cxx, 
1) add domain list and chain, 
2) domains will update the domain info in uplink heartbeat
3) add locate msg among domains, the msg will be forwarded from one domain to another, still reach the target, the path will be saved in msg as a stack.
4) locate msg will be responsed along the path stack.

*) bbqclient.cxx,

2) in RequestChannel(...), fixed a bug. when TCP login, should always use TCP to request channel.

BBQClient::Locate(...) add one more parameter "nFrom", default value is 0.
bool BBQClient::Locate( SIMD_SC_LOCATE & info, uint32 uid, PIPSocket::Address svrIp = 0, WORD svrPort = SIM_PORT, uint32 nFrom = 0 );
This is for MCU to decide the call from one user (nFrom) to another (uid) is allowed or not.
